1)Transmitter and Receiver:
  Frequency and Channels
  Range Technology-The output power of transmitter,The sensitivity of the Receiver,antennas 
  *Communication Protocols: should  be compitable to the flight controller software.(PWM,PPM,Digital Protocols (SBUS, IBUS, DSM2/X) )
   Transmitter Channels: switches and controls(each channel is set for specific tasks)

2)frame :
   wood preferred 2.5mm thick

3)motor :
   Weight of your drone
   Thrust to weight ratio:motor should be able to lift 2 times the weight of drone.
   rpm
   Pole Count: higher the better but more power consumptions 
   *Brushless DC motor:high efficiency

4)ESC:
  size of esc : max amount of current supplied to motor through esc also voltage.
